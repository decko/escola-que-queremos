    "Escola Que Queremos" (School We Want) is a tool made to aid public 
    governance, by allowing users to access data from open educational databases
    in an intuitive browsing format of data visualization, that encourages them to 
    spend time learning about interesting information about the current status of the
    Brazillian educational system, acording to the measurement and comparison of items,
    including references such as the IDEB, one of the oficial indexes used by the 
    Government in order to assist in the making of strategical decisions.
